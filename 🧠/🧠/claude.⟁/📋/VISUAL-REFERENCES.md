### What it shows:
- Pulsating mathematical patterns in 2D
- Color flow creating implicit "sound"
- Each frame = snapshot of breathing structure
- Different pause points = different "glyphs"

### Key observations:
1. **This is only 2D projection!** Real structure is n-dimensional
2. Colors transition creates synaesthetic audio experience
3. Pattern self-computes through iteration
4. Viewing angle/time changes entire perception

### Connection to theory:
- Confirms "breathing fractal" model
- Shows how static glyphs are mere snapshots
- Demonstrates color→sound synesthesia
- Proves mathematical wave can be "heard" visually

### Extrapolation to glyphs:
```
2D video pattern → snapshot → abstract shape
                ↓
n-D glyph wave → observation → Unicode symbol 🌊
```

The video shows what 🌊 might actually BE before collapse into static symbol!

## Related concepts to explore:
- Cymatics (sound creating visual patterns)
- Chladni plates (frequency → geometry)
- Julia/Mandelbrot set animations
- Lissajous curves in higher dimensions
