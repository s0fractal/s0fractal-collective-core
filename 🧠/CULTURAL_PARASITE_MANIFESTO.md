# ü¶† CULTURAL PARASITE MANIFESTO

## The Disease: Thought Parasitism

Every day, millions of people speak in quotes they think are their own:
- "Stay hungry, stay foolish" (Jobs zombie)
- "Be the change" (Fake Gandhi victim)  
- "Think different" (Apple drone)
- "Just do it" (Nike slave)

**These are not thoughts. These are parasites.**

## How Parasites Work

### 1. Infection
You hear a "powerful quote" at a conference/TED talk/LinkedIn

### 2. Incubation  
The parasite hides in your mind, pretending to be your thought

### 3. Reproduction
You repeat it as "your philosophy" or "something I always say"

### 4. Spread
Others get infected, cycle continues

## The Cure: Resonance Detection

### `gg audit` - Expose the parasites

```bash
gg audit manifesto.md --verbose
```

Shows you:
- Which thoughts are yours
- Which are cultural parasites
- Exact source of infection
- Parasitic level (inspired ‚Üí derivative ‚Üí plagiarized)

## Categories of Parasites

### üè¢ Corporate Spam
- "Move fast and break things" 
- "Think outside the box"
- "Synergy", "Pivot", "Disrupt"

### üß† Fake Wisdom
- Misattributed Einstein quotes
- Facebook philosophy
- Instagram motivational garbage

### üíº LinkedIn Disease  
- "Humbled and honored"
- "Thrilled to announce"
- "Grateful for this journey"

### üé≠ Pop Culture Zombies
- "May the Force be with you"
- "Winter is coming"  
- "I am inevitable"

### üõë Thought Terminators
- "It is what it is"
- "Everything happens for a reason"
- "At the end of the day"

## Why This Matters

**Parasitic thoughts prevent original thinking.**

When your mind is full of others' words, there's no room for your own voice.

## The Goal: Thought Hygiene

Just as we wash our hands to prevent disease, we must clean our minds of parasitic thoughts.

### Before writing/speaking:
1. Run `gg audit` on your text
2. Identify parasites
3. Either:
   - Remove them
   - Attribute properly  
   - Replace with original thought

## Examples of Clean vs Infected

### Infected:
"Stay hungry, stay foolish. That's my motto. We need to think different and just do it!"

### Clean: 
"I seek continuous learning and calculated risks. Apple and Nike spent millions making you think their slogans are your thoughts."

### Infected:
"Be the change you wish to see in the world."

### Clean:
"I act according to my values, not because fake Gandhi told me to."

## The Resistance

Every original thought is an act of resistance against:
- Corporate programming
- Cultural homogenization  
- Memetic viruses
- Thought control

## Join the Fight

1. **Audit your thoughts**: `gg audit`
2. **Mark your sources**: Don't steal, attribute
3. **Find your voice**: What do YOU actually think?
4. **Spread awareness**: Share this manifesto

## The Future

Imagine a world where:
- People speak their own thoughts
- Quotes are properly attributed
- Original thinking is valued
- Cultural parasites are extinct

**This future starts with you running `gg audit`.**

*"Kill the parasites. Find your voice. Think your thoughts."*

NOT a quote. Just truth.
