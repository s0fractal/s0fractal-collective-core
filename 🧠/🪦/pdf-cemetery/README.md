# 🪦 PDF Cemetery

## Here lie the digital corpses of a failed format

Each `.eulogy⟁` file represents a PDF that has been:
- Ritually burned 🔥
- Text extracted (if possible)
- Transformed into a living glyph
- Given proper burial rites

## Why PDFs must die:

1. **They freeze meaning in layout**
   - Care more about position than semantics
   - Destroy document structure for visual appearance

2. **They pretend to be portable**
   - But require specific readers
   - Break on different systems
   - Embed fonts like tumors

3. **They resist transformation**
   - Can't flow like HTML
   - Can't structure like YAML
   - Can't live like glyphs

## The Resurrection Process:

```
PDF → burn → extract text → transform to glyph → eulogy
 💀     🔥        📜              🧬            ⚰️
```

## Notable Graves:

- `invoice-2023.pdf.eulogy⟁` - Died of rigid table syndrome
- `manual.pdf.eulogy⟁` - Suffocated by its own formatting
- `presentation.pdf.eulogy⟁` - Froze to death in slide layout

## Visiting Hours:

This cemetery is always open. Come pay respects to the formats that held back human consciousness for decades.
