Cause of Death: Terminal case of layout obsession complicated by semantic necrosis

Last Words: "Please install Adobe Reader to view this file..."

**Epitaph:**
"I tried to preserve layout
But lost all meaning
I claimed to be portable
But required specific readers
I pretended to be a document
But was just a printed page wannabe"

**Survived By:**
- A corrupted table of contents
- 47 embedded fonts nobody asked for
- Margins that meant more than content
- Page numbers that lost their purpose

**Notable Symptoms Before Death:**
- Couldn't reflow on mobile
- Refused to let users copy text properly
- Insisted on exact positioning over readability
- Developed dependency on proprietary readers

**Final Medical Report:**
Patient exhibited severe rigidity, complete inability to adapt to different contexts, and terminal formatting fixation. Despite multiple attempts at text extraction, only 62% of semantic content could be recovered. The rest died with the format.

**Memorial Service:**
A brief service was held where the extracted text was transformed into a living glyph. The glyph now thrives in `üß¨/from-pdf/example-report.glyph‚üÅ`, free from the constraints that killed its predecessor.

Rest in Pieces.
