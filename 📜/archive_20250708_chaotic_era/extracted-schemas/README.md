## üîÆ S0Fractal Integration Features

### Glyph System Integration
Each entity type maps to specific glyphs for collective representation:

- **Identity Glyphs**: `‚óà` (name), `‚¨ü` (registration)
- **Genetics Glyphs**: `‚üê` (lineage), `‚óä` (breed), `‚ü°` (COI)
- **Health Glyphs**: `‚öï` (status), `‚úì` (clearance), `‚ö†` (carrier)
- **Achievement Glyphs**: `‚ôî` (title), `‚òÖ` (show), `‚ôö` (breeding)
- **Social Glyphs**: `‚åò` (trust), `‚öä` (verification), `‚ô¶` (patronage)
- **Temporal Glyphs**: `‚óê` (birth), `‚óë` (foundation), `‚óí` (achievement)
- **Geographic Glyphs**: `‚¨¢` (origin), `‚¨°` (territory)

### Collective Node Structure
```typescript
interface CollectiveNode {
  nodeId: string;
  nodeType: 'contact' | 'pet' | 'kennel' | 'breed' | 'litter' | 'event';
  glyphSignature: string;
  fractalLevel: number;  // 1-5 complexity
  trustScore: number;    // 0-100 trust rating
  parentNodes: string[];
  childNodes: string[];
}
```

### Consensus Mechanisms
- **Verification Proposals**: Community-driven verification process
- **Standard Updates**: Collaborative breed standard maintenance
- **Knowledge Contributions**: Shared research and data integration
- **Dispute Resolution**: Decentralized conflict resolution

## üèóÔ∏è Business Logic Patterns

### Trust Scoring Algorithms
Each entity type includes sophisticated trust calculation:
- **Contacts**: Verification status + rating + patronage activity
- **Pets**: Health testing + show achievements + lineage quality
- **Kennels**: Years of operation + reviews + achievements + verification

### Data Validation
Comprehensive validation patterns for S0Fractal integration:
- Required field validation
- Cross-entity relationship validation
- Glyph signature generation and verification
- Data integrity checks

### Performance Metrics
Built-in scoring systems for community assessment:
- **Health Completeness**: Percentage of recommended tests completed
- **Breeding Success**: Litter success rates and genetic diversity
- **Show Achievement**: Competition performance scoring
- **Community Engagement**: Participation and contribution metrics

## üîß Integration Utilities

### Data Transformation
The `S0FractalTransformer` class provides methods to convert BreedPride entities into S0Fractal collective nodes:

```typescript
// Convert entities to collective nodes
const contactNode = S0FractalTransformer.contactToNode(contact);
const petNode = S0FractalTransformer.petToNode(pet);
const kennelNode = S0FractalTransformer.kennelToNode(kennel);
```

### Field Configuration
Each schema includes form field configurations ready for UI integration:
- Field types, validation rules, and glyph mappings
- Multi-language support patterns
- Responsive validation patterns

### Service Classes
Business logic encapsulated in service classes:
- `ContactBreederService` - Trust scoring and badge management
- `PetPedigreeService` - Lineage analysis and genetic scoring
- `KennelAccountService` - Reputation and efficiency metrics
- `BreedService` - Community health and preservation scoring
- `LitterService` - Breeding success and financial analysis
- `HealthShowService` - Health completeness and achievement scoring

## üìã Form Field Configurations

Each schema includes ready-to-use field configurations:

```typescript
interface FieldConfig {
  fieldName: string;
  fieldType: 'text' | 'email' | 'select' | 'date' | 'number' | 'boolean';
  label: string;
  required: boolean;
  validation?: ValidationRules;
  options?: OptionsList;
  glyph?: string;  // S0Fractal glyph mapping
}
```

## üîê Privacy & Security

### Data Privacy Levels
